### 1. What is Emmet? 
Emmet is the essential toolkit for web developer. It allows us to type shortcut that are then expanded into full pieces of code for writting HTML and CSS.

### 2. Difference between library and framework? 
A library is a collection of packages that perform specific operations where as a framework contains the basic flow and architecture of an application. The major difference between them is the complexity. Libraries contain a number of methods that a developer can just call whenever they write code. React JS is library and Angular is Framework. The framework provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by developer as required. If a library is used, the application calls the code from the library.

### 3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It basically refers to collection of servers which are geographycally distributed to all over the world for faster delivery of content over the Internet. The main use of CDN is to deliver content through a network of server in a secure and efficient way.

### 4. Why React known as React?
React is  named React because of its ability to react to changes in data. It is basically designed to be a declarative, efficient, and flexible javascript library for buliding user interfaces. The name react was choosen because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner. React is a javascript based UI development library.

### 5. What is crossorigin in script tag?
The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS request. The purpose of the cross origin attribute is used to share the resoures from one domain to another domain. Basically, it is used to handle the CORS request that check whether it is safe to allow for sharing the resources from other domain. 

### 6. What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?
React is a javascript library for building User Interfaces whereas React DOM is a separate package that enables React to update and render UI components on the web browser by directly interacting with the browser's Document Object Model (DOM), ensuring smooth, dynamic user experiences by not reloading the whole page.

### 7. What is the difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Development is the stage of an application before it's made public while production is the term used for the same application when it's made public. Development build is several times slower than the production build. 

### 8. What is async and defer?
Async and defer are boolean attribute. Script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available (do not block HTML DOM construction during downloading process) and do not wait for anything.
